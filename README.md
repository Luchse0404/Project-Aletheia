# Project-Aletheia
**A Decentralized, Sovereign Infrastructure for European Public Service Media.**

# What is Project Aletheia?
Project Aletheia is an architectural proposal to reform the technological backbone of European Public Broadcasting. Instead of maintaining 27 fragmented national IT infrastructures, it proposes a unified **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** model. 

It combines a geo-redundant server cluster (France-Germany-Poland), an AI-driven ingest pipeline for pan-European localization, and a "Public Money, Public Content" distribution model based on open standards. The goal is to reduce redundancy, increase reach through AI translation, and restore trust through open-source transparency.
