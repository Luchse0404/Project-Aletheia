**A Decentralized, Sovereign Infrastructure for European Public Service Media.**

> ⚠️ **Status:** RFC (Request for Comments) - Draft v1.0

## 📂 Core Documentation
Don't just read the summary—read the architecture:

1. **[The Problem Analysis](Concept/Whats_the_problem.md)** *Why Europe spends more than Netflix but gets less scaling.*
   
2. **[The Architecture Proposal](Concept/What_I_propose.md)** *The "Weimar Triangle" Backbone, BaaS model, and Open Source stack.*

## 🧐 What is Project Aletheia?
Project Aletheia is an architectural proposal to reform the technological backbone of European Public Broadcasting. Instead of maintaining 27 fragmented national IT infrastructures, it proposes a unified **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** model. 

It combines:
* 🌍 A geo-redundant server cluster (**Paris-Frankfurt-Warsaw**)
* 🤖 An AI-driven ingest pipeline for pan-European localization
* 🔓 A "Public Money, Public Content" distribution model based on **Open Source** (GPLv3).

The goal is to reduce redundancy, increase reach through AI translation, and restore trust through transparency.

## 🤝 Want to help?
This is a living document. I am looking for **architectural challenges**, **security audits**, and **logical refactoring**.

* **Read the RFCs** linked above.
* **Open an Issue** for discussion.
* **Submit a Pull Request** if you spot logical inconsistencies or typos.
