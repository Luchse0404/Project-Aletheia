# Current state
Currently, European public broadcasting operates as a fragmented collection of 27+ national entities. Each maintains its own full technology stack: separate transcoding farms, separate content management systems, separate hosting contracts, and separate app development teams.
* **Redundancy:** We are paying for the same infrastructure development 27 times over.
* **Silos:** Content is locked behind language barriers and geoblocking. A German documentary is technically invisible to a Polish viewer.
* **Budget Efficiency:** Approximately €16 billion in annual public funding is diluted by high operational expenditures (OpEx) rather than flowing into content creation.

# Why that doesn't work anymore
The era of national broadcast monopolies is over. Global platforms like Netflix, YouTube, and TikTok operate on a "Write Once, Read Everywhere" model with near-zero marginal cost per additional user.
* **Scale:** National broadcasters cannot compete with the economies of scale of US tech giants. A proprietary player developed for 5 million users is mathematically inferior to one developed for 500 million.
* **Demographics:** Younger audiences do not differentiate between "TV" and "Internet". They expect instant access, high resolution (4K), and barrier-free usability. The current "Mediathek" model feels archaic and user-hostile compared to commercial streaming UX.

# What I assume will happen if we don't reform the public broadcasting in europe
If we continue with the status quo, European public media will face a slow descent into irrelevance.
* **Loss of Sovereignty:** We will become dependent on US and Chinese algorithms to reach our own citizens.
* **The "Museum" Effect:** Public broadcasters will become archives for an aging population, while the youth consumes exclusively commercial, algorithm-driven content.
* **Democratic Deficit:** Without a functioning, shared European digital public sphere, disinformation will continue to fragment our societies. We will lose the ability to have a shared conversation across borders.

# The Efficiency Gap: Europe Outspends, But Underscales
The common narrative is that Public Service Media (PSM) is underfunded. The hard data suggests otherwise. 

According to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the combined operating revenues of PSM in the EBU area amounted to **€40 billion in 2023**[^1].
When we compare this to the audited financial statements of the global market leader, Netflix, a startling reality emerges:

* **Netflix Total Revenue (2024):** ~$39.0 Billion[^2]
* **Netflix Global Content Spend (Cash, 2024):** ~$16.2 Billion[^2]
* **European PSM Combined Budget:** **€40.0 Billion**[^1]

**Conclusion:** The European public media system has a larger total budget than Netflix generates in revenue. We are better funded than the Silicon Valley giant. This is not a call to imitate Netflix’s editorial strategy — only to acknowledge the structural efficiency of scaling shared technological infrastructure.

However, this financial weight does not translate into digital dominance because of the **Efficiency Gap**:
* Netflix scales one tech stack to 280+ million subscribers.
* Europe funds 27+ parallel, redundant infrastructure stacks, transcoder farms, and administrative bodies.

We do not have a revenue problem. We have an allocation problem. The same budget, deployed through a shared sovereign technical backbone, would unlock scale that no individual member state could achieve alone. This proposal does not require replacing national media institutions — only replacing redundant infrastructure with shared infrastructure.
