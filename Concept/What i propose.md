# What I Propose — A Modernized European Public Broadcasting Stack

Aletheia is a European-scale public broadcasting technology platform that consolidates infrastructure — not editorial control — into a shared sovereign backbone.

---

## 1. Infrastructure: The “Weimar Triangle” Backbone

The core principle is separation of **infrastructure** from **curation**.

- **The Unified Core Cluster**  
  A geo-redundant Tier-4 cluster across **Paris → Frankfurt → Warsaw**.  
  Connected via dark fiber, forming the sovereign media backbone of Europe.

- **Active–Active–Active**  
  If Paris goes dark, Frankfurt and Warsaw absorb load automatically.  
  No “national broadcast outage” because a cooling pump failed in Munich.

- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)**  
  The platform provides:
  - Storage
  - Transcoding
  - Live ingest + replay buffer
  - AI translation + dubbing
  - Streaming + download endpoints

- **Sovereignty by Design**  
  National broadcasters retain:
  - Their brand
  - Their app UX
  - Their editorial decisions

Aletheia delivers **pipes and cranes**, not **opinions or headlines**.

## 2. The Data Standard — “Matroska First”

The platform adopts a **public, durable, archival-grade container**.

> The `.mkv` file is the *Gold Master*.

### The “Super-Container”
One file — everything:

| Asset | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| 4K HEVC/AV1 | Future-proof visual master |
| Original + AI Dub + Human Sync | 24 official languages |
| Subtitles | Accessibility + education |
| C2PA Metadata | Provenance, editorial chain-of-custody |
| Accessibility Tracks | Audio description + sign language |

### Distribution Logic
- **Stream:** Transmux → DASH/HLS
- **Download:** The full `.mkv` — public money, public copy

People used to save newspapers — this is the digital equivalent.

---

## 3. User Experience — The Twin-App Ecosystem

The platform serves two fundamentally different use cases.

- **Sentinel — The News Interface**
  - Chronological feed (not rage ranking)
  - Local → National → European layering
  - Live democracy (hearings, parliaments, town halls)

- **Cinema — The Cultural & Entertainment Interface**
  - Browsing, recommendations, binge
  - Documentaries, dramas, performing arts
  - European film festivals surfaced for the first time at scale

- **The Bridge**
  Cross-pollination driven by semantics, not engagement addiction.  
  Watch a drama on mining towns → see the documentary → hear the historian.

---

## 4. AI & the “History X-Ray Protocol”

AI is used to **increase access**, not **erase discomfort**.

### Ingest Pipeline
- Language model creates:
  - **AI dubs**
  - **Transcripts**
  - **Context summaries**
- Super-resolution upscales historical footage

### Contextualization Layer — The Seatbelt Model
- Sensitive content triggers a **non-skippable context explainer**
- Disabled for 4h to respect binge
- Verified by **historians**, not machine confidence scores

AI flags — humans decide.

---

## 5. Public Money, Public Content — The Licensing Model

### Tier 1 — Fully Public Content
- Financed by the taxpayer
- **Download permitted**
- **Remix permitted**
- **Commercial resale forbidden**
- Attribution required

### Tier 2 — Strategic Premium Licensing
- Sports rights, cinema, marquee events
- EBU acts as a purchasing cartel
- Rights: Stream, time-limited, DRM

Come for the football — stay for the Parliament.

---

## 6. Open Source as the Anchor of Trust

- **All backend code open-source**
- **Provenance via C2PA signatures**
- No advertising IDs
- No tracking
- No login needed to consume

Trust is not a feature — it is architecture.

---

## 7. Migration Strategy — The Strangler-Pattern Redeployment

This is not a revolution — it is a coexistence strategy.

> You don’t replace the house.  
> You build the extension people choose to live in.

### Phase 0 — Non-invasive API Adapters
Legacy CMS → emits content to Aletheia format  
Nothing shuts down. No political shock.

### Phase 1 — New Archive & Ingest
All new content ingests into Aletheia  
Legacy stays where it is.

### Phase 2 — Gradual Consumer Switch
National apps route video/audio through Aletheia endpoints  
CMS, newsrooms, frontends untouched.

### Phase 3 — Inventory Absorption
Archives are migrated when:
- Rights clear
- Format convertible
- Value confirmed

### Phase 4 — Retirement of National Transcode + Storage
The expensive part — gone last, not first.

> Savings fund new content, not layoffs.

## Regulatory Note (Minimal but Necessary)

To enable this platform, only three lightweight legal adjustments are essential:

| Policy Area | Required Adjustment |
|-------------|--------------------|
| Rights | Mandate standard archival ownership for publicly financed works |
| Procurement | Allow cross-border infra procurement for digital services |
| Data | Define media backbone as critical infrastructure |

No treaty rewrite. No constitutional fireworks.

## Summary

**Europe spends like a streaming superpower**  
but **deploys like 27 regional cable companies**.

This proposal:
- Leaves national identity intact
- Reduces redundancy
- Increases access
- Establishes European digital sovereignty
- Converts spend into value

Aletheia is not a platform.  
It is the infrastructure public broadcasting should have always shared.
